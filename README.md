### Projekt ≈ÅƒÖcza ≈öwiat≈Çowodowego
The file contains the designed fiber optic connector. The main task was to meet the design assumptions by calculating the individual parameters and selecting the appropriate components.

In this project, I studied the reflection of a radio signal bouncing off the walls of a room by simulating appropriate cases in Python.
