## My projects ðŸ¤“
### Symulacja Kodera Polaryzacjnego
Simulation of polar encoder used in modern telecommunications. Polar codes are error-correcting codes that play an important role in 5G networks. The project implements encoding algorithms and analyzes their performance.<br>Technologies: Python

### Interfejs do kontroli i analizy USRP
Simple interface for controlling USRP devices and analyzing radio signals. The application provides basic controls for software-defined radio operations and real-time signal monitoring with data storage capabilities.<br>Technologies: Dash, MongoDB

### Dashboard czujnikÃ³w LoRa
Data visualization dashboard for LoRa IoT sensors. Displays sensor readings in real-time with interactive charts and monitoring features across multiple visualization platforms.<br>Technologies: Dash, Grafana

### Aplikacja To Do na UrzÄ…dzenio iOS
Basic task management app for iOS devices. Includes functionality for creating, editing, and organizing tasks with a clean, user-friendly interface designed from scratch.<br>Technologies: Swift, Figma

### Ray Launcher w Moim Pokoju
Radio wave propagation simulation in indoor environment. The project studies signal reflection patterns in a room using simulations to analyze multipath effects.<br>Technologies: Python

### Symulacja Systemu Transmisji TCM (Trellis Coded Modulation)
Group project implementing TCM transmission system simulation. The Python program models trellis-coded modulation with a custom graphical interface (my contribution focused on GUI development).<br>Technologies: Python, CustomTkinter

### Aplikacja Pogodowa na UrzÄ…dzenia Android
Weather forecast application for Android with date-based search functionality. Users can check weather predictions for specific dates with a simple interface.<br>Technologies: Kotlin

### Komputerowa Analiza Å¹rÃ³dÅ‚a PrÄ…dowego
Computer analysis of current source circuits using field-effect and bipolar transistors. The project includes multiple simulations to study circuit behavior and characteristics.<br>Technologies: LTSpice
