# Electronics and Telecommunications üì°

My name is Maciej Niedzwiecki. I am a student of the Poznan University of Technology in the field of Electronics and Telecommunications. In this repository you can find files related to my field of study. Feel free to contact me.

## My projects ü§ì

### Aplikacja Pogodowa na UrzƒÖdzenia Android
The project involved writing a weather forecast application with the ability to search for a forecast based on the date provided by the user. 

### Komputerowa Analiza ≈πr√≥d≈Ça PrƒÖdowego
The files contain the analysis of a 'current source with a field-effect and bipolar transistor' through numerous simulations in the LTspice program dedicated to testing electronic devices.

### Projekt ≈ÅƒÖcza ≈öwiat≈Çowodowego
The file contains the designed fiber optic connector. The main task was to meet the design assumptions by calculating the individual parameters and selecting the appropriate components.

### Ray Launcher w Moim Pokoju
This project was focused on studying the reflection of a radio signal bouncing off the walls of a room by simulating appropriate cases in Python.

### Symulacja Systemu Transmisji TCM (Trellis Coded Modulation)
In this project, I had the opportunity to work in a group.  The Python program simulates the TCM system.  My task was to code the GUI using the CustomTkinter extension.
